7. Click on the Button corosponding with your operating system. This would include downloading an executable on Windows and Mac, and doing terminal stuff in linux.

If you are on a phone then it will take you to the app store, and you can install it from there.

8. Once it is installed then open it and login using your username and password at the begining.
*If you have more then one device then this process is more complicated its then recommended that and then follow the instructions provided in the app.


9. Once in your account go to devices on the side of your screen (on mobile you need to click on the hamberger first.) Once you are at this scren click make a new paper key.

It should look like this.

After you do this make sure to write it down somewhere safe, if you ever lose access to a device, this will make sure you are not locked out of your keybase account.

(At this point its also reccommended to verify your email and add some details to your bio.)

10. Tell your XR contact your keybase username and then they can add you to the team.
